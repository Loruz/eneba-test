# eneba-test

Hi guys, was fun to take a shot on this test task. Actually learned a lot :) So leaving few comments and instruction list with progress.

By Instructions:
- No CSS frameworks (like foundation/bootstrap) :white_check_mark:
- Everything needs to be written in React (bonus points for typescript) :white_check_mark: `(Typescript used only on React app, for server side used simple JS)`
- Responsive design (you can choose how mobile will look like) :white_check_mark:
- Form validation :white_check_mark: `(Added simple, custom made validation, both on front and API sides, for now just as required fields)`
- Submit the form to an API, write your own rest/graphql mock server (bonus points for using graphql) :white_check_mark:
- Load the whole page (content) from an API, write your own rest/graphql mock server (bonus points for using graphql) :white_check_mark: `(Left few places for static content)`
- Only one page is required (links should contain #)  :white_check_mark:
- Submit to a git repo with multiple commits to view the process  :white_check_mark: (As you can see :))

## Setup project

Clone repo that contains 2 subfolders `client` and `server`, in main `package.json` run `npm run server` to spin off graphl server on `localhost:4000` and then `npm run client` 
for React app
